##Original Data

The original data source can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Data Acquisition

The data is acquired automatically by the script. Please make sure to set your working directory at line 6 of the script, variable ```working.directory```.

When the script is run, the following steps happen for obtaining the data:

 1. A directory named data is created (if not already existing) in the current working directory
 2. The working directory is switched to the data folder
 3. If the original data set (named *dataset.zip*) does not exist already, the data set is downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and named dataset.zip
 4. The dataset is unzipped. The original dataset is present in data/UCI HAR

##Data Transformation

Starting from the originary dataset, the following high-level steps are performed

 1. The files features.txt, *train/X_train.txt*, and *test/X_test.txt* are loaded as data tables. The X_ tables are combined via ```rbind()```. At this point, the initial dataframe *features* is comprised of 561 variables, as follows.

 2. As requested by step 2 of the [Project page](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-003/human_grading/view/courses/972136/assessments/3/submissions), only the measurements of the mean and the standard deviation are retained from the originary dataset. This is achieved via ```df <- df[, grep(".*\\.(mean|std)\\.\\..*", names(df), value=T)]``` The intermediary dataframe *features* is comprised of 66 variables at this point


 3. The subject files *train\subject_train.tx*t and *test\subject_test.txt* are loaded and combined via the rbind() command


 4. The activity files *train\y_train.txt* and *test\y_test.txt* are loaded and combined via the rbind() command in the *activities* dataframe


 5. As requested by step 3 of the Project page, the descriptive names for the activities, found in *activity_labels.txt*, are used in the intermediary *activities* dataset. The dataframes *subjects* and *activities* are cbind()'ed

 6. Point 1 of the Project page is performed. The training and the test sets are merged to create one data set. 

 At this point, the combined dataframe *df* is comprised of 68 variables.
 7. A series of regular expressions clean the name of the variables. The variables of the original data set are in the form ```fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z```. R automatically converts the unfriendly symbols, e.g., ```fBodyAccJerk.mean...Z.``` The regular expressions transform the intermediary names in R coding standard-friendly names, e.g., ```f.body.acc.jerk.mean.z```. The variables are listed below.
 8. The intermediary dataframe is melted to obtain all the activities performed by all the users, and their average values. The melted database has 679734 observations of 4 variables. 
 9. An *O(N^3)* for loop is performed, first using the unique subject values, then the unique activity values per subject, then the variable values. The average values are computed and stored in the means temporary variable. Before the end of the outer loop cycle, the means variable is appended to the soon-to-be-born tidy dataset.
 10. The columns are re-ordered to have subject and activity as first columns
 11. The dataset *tidymeans.txt* is produced and exported in the original working directory (where the script is).


##Variables

The following is a table representing the variables of the tidy dataset. They are provided as they appear in the dataset.
Variable subject is the participant anonymous code from the original experiment. It is an integer number ranging from 0 to 30.
Variable activity is a categorical variable of the activity performed by the participants. Its value is one from the set ```{LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS}.````

All the other variables (ID 3 to 68) are the average of each original variable (see the third column) for each activity and each subject. Their value is numeric (float). It can be negative or positive.

The features variables generally follow the following naming convention

```{f|t}.{body|gravity}.{acc|gyro}.{mag|mean|std}```

where

t is time, f is the frequency, body and gravity are reference frames, acc is the accelerometer, gyro is the gyroscope, mag is the euclidean magnitude, mean is the average value, and std is the standard deviation. Jerk, where present, is the jerk signal, as opposed to smooth signal (everything else)

##Dataset format

The tidy dataset is a fixed length format "CSV" as the write.table() R function outputs typically.
The first row contains the variable names, separated by a single space character.
All the subsequent rows are dataset entries, still separated by a single space character.
